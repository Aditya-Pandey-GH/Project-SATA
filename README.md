# 🚀 SATA – Self-Assessed Training Architecture
## Your AI-powered Learning Companion for DSA and Web Development

### 🧠 Problem Statement

Today, learners and developers face a fragmented ecosystem. DSA practice happens on LeetCode, development projects live on GitHub, and notes are scattered across Notion or local files. Tracking real progress and building consistency is hard — students lose motivation, fail to follow structured learning paths, and lack personalized AI-driven guidance.

Even educators and bootcamps find it difficult to monitor student growth efficiently. There’s no unified platform that can track learning, practice, and AI-generated schedules all in one space.

In short, learning development is slowed down not by a lack of curiosity, but by the lack of structure and intelligent tracking.
